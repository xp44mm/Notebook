# Part 3. Mastering RxJS

Now that you have a firm grasp of the basics of RxJS, it's time to start working with some advanced techniques. We'll cover sharing your streams between observers, as well as a detailed discussion of eager versus lazy types and how observables are able to handle both scenarios gracefully. We'll also go back to some concepts about time that we only teased you with in the first part of the book; we'll show you how to use them to build powerful declarative tests that can run with user-defined concepts of time.

In chapter 8, we'll talk about the difference between hot and cold streams, how to identify the two types, and how to move between them easily using RxJS operators. Chapter 9 covers reactive testing and provides an introduction to the scheduling abstraction, which is a powerful concept that allows you to run tests faster than real time. Finally, in chapter 10 we'll wrap up by bringing together everything you've learned to create a basic banking application using React, Redux, and RxJS. This combo will help give you an idea of the potential for integration afforded by RxJS, as well as the strategies and benefits of maintaining a single-directional flow of events through an application.
