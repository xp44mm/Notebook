# 13.1.2.4 Optional tags

Certain tags can be omitted.

Omitting an element's start tag in the situations described below does not mean the element is not present; it is implied, but it is still there.

## html

For example, an HTML document always has a root `html` element, even if the string `<html>` doesn't appear anywhere in the markup.

An `html` element's start tag may be omitted if the first thing inside the `html` element is not a comment.

For example, in the following case it's ok to remove the "`<html>`" tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Doing so would make the document look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This has the exact same DOM. In particular, note that whitespace around the document element is ignored by the parser. The following example would also have the exact same DOM:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML><head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

However, in the following example, removing the start tag moves the comment to before the `html` element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

With the tag removed, the document actually turns into the same as this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is why the tag can only be removed if it is not followed by a comment: removing the tag when there is a comment there changes the document's resulting parse tree. Of course, if the position of the comment does not matter, then the tag can be omitted, as if the comment had been moved to before the start tag in the first place.

An `html` element's end tag may be omitted if the `html` element is not immediately followed by a comment.

A `head` element's start tag may be omitted if the element is empty, or if the first thing inside the `head` element is an element.

A `head` element's end tag may be omitted if the `head` element is not immediately followed by `/\s/` or a comment.

A `body` element's start tag may be omitted if the element is empty, or if the first thing inside the `body` element is not `/\s/` or a comment, except if the first thing inside the `body` element is a `meta`, `link`, `script`, `style`, or `template` element.

A `body` element's end tag may be omitted if the `body` element is not immediately followed by a comment.

Note that in the example above, the `head` element start and end tags, and the `body` element start tag, can't be omitted, because they are surrounded by whitespace:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

(The `body` and `html` element end tags could be omitted without trouble; any spaces after those get parsed into the `body` element anyway.)

Usually, however, whitespace isn't an issue. If we first remove the whitespace we don't care about:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML><html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body><p>Welcome to this example.</p></body></html>
```

Then we can omit a number of tags without affecting the DOM:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML><title>Hello</title><p>Welcome to this example.</p>
```

At that point, we can also add some whitespace back:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<title>Hello</title>
<p>Welcome to this example.</p>
```

This would be equivalent to this document, with the omitted tags shown in their parser-implied positions; the only whitespace text node that results from this is the newline at the end of the `head` element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html><head><title>Hello</title>
</head><body><p>Welcome to this example.</p></body></html>
```

## li

An `li` element's end tag may be omitted if the `li` element is immediately followed by another `li` element or if there is no more content in the parent element.

Inside `ol` elements.

Inside `ul` elements.

Inside `menu` elements.

## dt, dd

A `dt` element's end tag may be omitted if the `dt` element is immediately followed by another `dt` element or a `dd` element.

A `dd` element's end tag may be omitted if the `dd` element is immediately followed by another `dd` element or a `dt` element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.

[Contexts in which this element can be used](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#concept-element-contexts):

After `dt` or `dd` elements inside `dl` elements.

## p

A `p` element's end tag may be omitted if the `p` element is immediately followed by an `address`, `article`, `aside`, `blockquote`, `details`, `div`, `dl`, `fieldset`, `figcaption`, `figure`, `footer`, `form`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `header`, `hgroup`, `hr`, `main`, `menu`, `nav`, `ol`, `p`, `pre`, `section`, `table`, or `ul` element, or if there is no more content in the parent element and the parent element is an HTML element that is not an `a`, `audio`, `del`, `ins`, `map`, `noscript`, or `video` element, or an autonomous custom element.

[Contexts in which this element can be used](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#concept-element-contexts):

Where [flow content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#flow-content-2) is expected.

```

## rt, rp

An `rt` element's end tag may be omitted if the `rt` element is immediately followed by an `rt` or `rp` element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.

The ability to omit all these table-related tags makes table markup much terser.

Take this example:

```html
<table>
 <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)</caption>
 <colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Function</th>
   <th>Control Unit</th>
   <th>Central Station</th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Headlights</td>
   <td>✔</td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Interior Lights</td>
   <td>✔</td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds</td>
   <td>✔</td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Engineer's cab lighting</td>
   <td></td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Station Announcements - Swiss</td>
   <td></td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
```

The exact same table, modulo some whitespace differences, could be marked up as follows:

```html
<table>
 <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
 <colgroup><col><col><col>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Function
   <th>Control Unit
   <th>Central Station
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Headlights
   <td>✔
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Interior Lights
   <td>✔
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds
   <td>✔
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Engineer's cab lighting
   <td>
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Station Announcements - Swiss
   <td>
   <td>✔
</table>
```

Since the cells take up much less room this way, this can be made even terser by having each row on one line:

```html
<table>
 <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
 <colgroup><col><col><col>
 <thead>
  <tr> <th>Function                              <th>Control Unit     <th>Central Station
 <tbody>
  <tr> <td>Headlights                            <td>✔                <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Interior Lights                       <td>✔                <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds  <td>✔                <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Engineer's cab lighting               <td>                 <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Station Announcements - Swiss         <td>                 <td>✔
</table>
```

The only differences between these tables, at the DOM level, is with the precise position of the (in any case semantically-neutral) whitespace.

## However

However, a start tag must never be omitted if it has any attributes.

Returning to the earlier example with all the whitespace removed and then all the optional tags removed:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML><title>Hello</title><p>Welcome to this example.
```

If the `body` element in this example had to have a `class` attribute and the `html` element had to have a `lang` attribute, the markup would have to become:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML><html lang="en"><title>Hello</title><body class="demo"><p>Welcome to this example.
```

This section assumes that the document is conforming, in particular, that there are no content model violations. Omitting tags in the fashion described in this section in a document that does not conform to the content models described in this specification is likely to result in unexpected DOM differences (this is, in part, what the content models are designed to avoid).
