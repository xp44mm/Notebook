Chapter 13. Scheduling
When a piece of code executes, it has to run on some thread somewhere. A
scheduler is an object that decides where a certain piece of code runs. There are
a few different scheduler types in the .NET framework, and they’re used with
slight differences by parallel and dataflow code.
I recommend that you not specify a scheduler whenever possible; the defaults
are usually correct. For example, the await operator in asynchronous code will
automatically resume the method within the same context unless you override
this default, as described in Recipe 2.7. Similarly, reactive code has reasonable
default contexts for raising its events, which you can override with ObserveOn,
as described in Recipe 6.2.
If you need other code to execute in a specific context (e.g., a UI thread context
or an ASP.NET request context), then you can use the scheduling recipes in
this chapter to control the scheduling of your code.
13.1 Scheduling Work to the Thread Pool
Problem
You have a piece of code that you explicitly want to execute on a threadpool
thread.
Solution
The vast majority of the time, you’ll want to use Task.Run, which is quite
simple. The following code blocks a threadpool thread for 2 seconds:
Task task = Task.Run(() =>
{
  Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
});
Task.Run also understands return values and asynchronous lambdas just fine.
The task returned by Task.Run in the following code will complete after 2
seconds with a result of 13:
Task<int> task = Task.Run(async () =>
{
  await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
  return 13;
});
Task.Run returns a Task (or Task<T>), which can be naturally consumed by
asynchronous or reactive code.
Discussion
Task.Run is ideal for UI applications, when you have time-consuming work to
do that cannot be done on the UI thread. For example, Recipe 8.4 uses
Task.Run to push parallel processing to a threadpool thread. However, do not
use Task.Run on ASP.NET unless you’re absolutely sure you know what
you’re doing. On ASP.NET, request handling code is already running on a
threadpool thread, so pushing it onto another threadpool thread is usually
counterproductive.
Task.Run is an effective replacement for BackgroundWorker,
Delegate.BeginInvoke, and ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem. None of
those older APIs should be used in new code; code using Task.Run is much
easier to write correctly and maintain over time. Furthermore, Task.Run
handles the vast majority of use cases for Thread, so most uses of Thread can
also be replaced with Task.Run (with the rare exception of single-thread
apartment threads).
Parallel and dataflow code executes on the thread pool by default, so there’s
usually no need to use Task.Run with code executed by the Parallel, Parallel
LINQ, or TPL Dataflow libraries.
If you’re doing dynamic parallelism, then use Task.Factory.StartNew
instead of Task.Run. This is necessary because the Task returned by Task.Run
has its default options configured for asynchronous use (i.e., to be consumed by
asynchronous or reactive code). It also doesn’t support advanced concepts, such
as parent/child tasks, which are more common in dynamic parallel code.

Recipe 8.6 covers consuming asynchronous code (such as the task returned
from Task.Run) with reactive code.
Recipe 8.4 covers asynchronously waiting for parallel code, which is most
easily done via Task.Run.
Recipe 4.4 covers dynamic parallelism, a scenario where you should use
Task.Factory.StartNew instead of Task.Run.
13.2 Executing Code with a Task Scheduler
Problem
You have multiple pieces of code that you need to execute in a certain way. For
example, you may need all the pieces of code to execute on the UI thread, or
you may need to execute only a certain number at a time.
This recipe deals with how to define and construct a scheduler for those pieces
of code. Actually applying that scheduler is the subject of the next two recipes.
Solution
There are quite a few different types in .NET that can handle scheduling; this
recipe focuses on TaskScheduler because it’s portable and relatively easy to
use.
The simplest TaskScheduler is TaskScheduler.Default, which queues work
to the thread pool. You will seldomly specify TaskScheduler.Default in your
own code, but it’s important to be aware of it, since it’s the default for many
scheduling scenarios. Task.Run, parallel, and dataflow code all use
TaskScheduler.Default.
You can capture a specific context and later schedule work back to it by using
TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext:
TaskScheduler scheduler = 
TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext();
This code creates a TaskScheduler to capture the current
SynchronizationContext and schedule code onto that context.
SynchronizationContext is a type that represents a general-purpose
scheduling context. There are several different contexts in the .NET
framework; most UI frameworks provide a SynchronizationContext that
represents the UI thread, and ASP.NET before Core provided a
SynchronizationContext that represented the HTTP request context.
ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair is another powerful type introduced in
.NET 4.5; this is actually two schedulers that are related to each other. The
ConcurrentScheduler member is a scheduler that allows multiple tasks to
execute at the same time, as long as no task is executing on the
ExclusiveScheduler. The ExclusiveScheduler only executes code one task
at a time, and only when there’s no task already executing on the
ConcurrentScheduler:
var schedulerPair = new ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair();
TaskScheduler concurrent = schedulerPair.ConcurrentScheduler;
TaskScheduler exclusive = schedulerPair.ExclusiveScheduler;
One common utilization for ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair is to just
use the ExclusiveScheduler to ensure only one task is executed at a time.
Code that executes on the ExclusiveScheduler will run on the thread pool but
will be restricted to executing exclusive of all other code using the same
ExclusiveScheduler instance.
Another use for ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair is as a throttling
scheduler. You can create a ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair that will
limit its own concurrency. In this scenario, the ExclusiveScheduler is usually
not used:
var schedulerPair = new ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair(
    TaskScheduler.Default, maxConcurrencyLevel: 8);
TaskScheduler scheduler = schedulerPair.ConcurrentScheduler;
Note that this kind of throttling only throttles code while it is executing; it’s
quite different than the kind of logical throttling covered in Recipe 12.5. In
particular, asynchronous code is not considered to be executing while it is
awaiting an operation. The ConcurrentScheduler throttles executing code;
other throttling, such as SemaphoreSlim, throttles at a higher level (i.e., an
entire async method).
Discussion
You may have noticed that the last code example passed
TaskScheduler.Default into the constructor for
ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair. This is because
ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair applies its concurrent/exclusive logic
around an existing TaskScheduler.
This recipe introduces
TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext, which is useful for
executing code on a captured context. It is also possible to use
SynchronizationContext directly to execute code on that context; however, I
don’t recommend this approach. Whenever possible, use the await operator to
resume on an implicitly captured context, or use a TaskScheduler wrapper.
Don’t ever use platform-specific types to execute code on a UI thread. WPF,
Silverlight, iOS, and Android all provide the Dispatcher type, Universal
Windows uses the CoreDispatcher, and Windows Forms has the
ISynchronizeInvoke interface (i.e., Control.Invoke). Do not use any of
these types in new code; just pretend they don’t exist. Using them ties your
code to a specific platform unnecessarily. SynchronizationContext is a
general-purpose abstraction around these types.
System.Reactive (Rx) introduces a more general scheduler abstraction:
IScheduler. An Rx scheduler is capable of wrapping any other kind of
scheduler; the TaskPoolScheduler will wrap any TaskFactory (which
contains a TaskScheduler). The Rx team also defined an IScheduler
implementation that can be manually controlled for testing. If you do need to
use a scheduler abstraction, I’d recommend the IScheduler from Rx; it’s well
designed, well defined, and test friendly. However, most of the time you don’t
need a scheduler abstraction, and earlier libraries, such as the Task Parallel
Library (TPL) and TPL Dataflow, only understand the TaskScheduler type.

13.3 Scheduling Parallel Code
Problem
You need to control how the individual pieces of code are executed in parallel
code.
Solution
Once you create an appropriate TaskScheduler instance (see Recipe 13.2), you
can include it in the options that you pass to a Parallel method. The following
code takes a sequence of sequences of matrices. It starts a bunch of parallel
loops and wants to limit the total parallelism of all loops simultaneously,
regardless of how many matrices are in each sequence:
void RotateMatrices(IEnumerable<IEnumerable<Matrix>> collections, float 
degrees)
{
  var schedulerPair = new ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair(
      TaskScheduler.Default, maxConcurrencyLevel: 8);
  TaskScheduler scheduler = schedulerPair.ConcurrentScheduler;
  ParallelOptions options = new ParallelOptions { TaskScheduler = 
scheduler };
  Parallel.ForEach(collections, options,
      matrices => Parallel.ForEach(matrices, options,
          matrix => matrix.Rotate(degrees)));
}
Discussion
Parallel.Invoke also takes an instance of ParallelOptions, so you can pass
a TaskScheduler to Parallel.Invoke the same way as Parallel.ForEach.
If you’re doing dynamic parallel code, you can pass TaskScheduler directly to
TaskFactory.StartNew or Task.ContinueWith.
There is no way to pass a TaskScheduler to Parallel LINQ (PLINQ) code.

Recipe 13.2 covers common task schedulers and how to choose between them.
13.4 Dataflow Synchronization Using Schedulers
Problem
You need to control how the individual pieces of code are executed in dataflow
code.
Solution
Once you create an appropriate TaskScheduler instance (see Recipe 13.2), you
can include it in the options that you pass to a dataflow block. When called
from the UI thread, the following code creates a dataflow mesh that multiplies
all of its input values by two (using the thread pool) and then appends the
resulting values to the items of a list box (on the UI thread):
var options = new ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions
{
  TaskScheduler = TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext(),
};
var multiplyBlock = new TransformBlock<int, int>(item => item * 2);
var displayBlock = new ActionBlock<int>(
    result => ListBox.Items.Add(result), options);
multiplyBlock.LinkTo(displayBlock);
Discussion
Specifying a TaskScheduler is especially useful in coordinating the actions of
blocks in different parts of your dataflow mesh. For example, you can utilize
the ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair.ExclusiveScheduler to ensure
that blocks A and C never execute code at the same time, while allowing block
B to execute whenever it wants.
Keep in mind that synchronization by TaskScheduler only applies while the
code is executing. For example, if you have an action block that runs
asynchronous code and apply an exclusive scheduler, the code isn’t considered
running when it is awaiting.
You can specify a TaskScheduler for any kind of dataflow block. Even though
a block may not execute your code (e.g., BufferBlock<T>), it still has
housekeeping tasks that it needs to do, and it’ll use the provided
TaskScheduler for all of its internal work.
